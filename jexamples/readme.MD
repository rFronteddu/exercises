## Walls and Gates

The "Walls and Gates" problem is a typical breadth-first search (BFS) 
problem often asked in interviews or programming contests. 
The problem statement is usually something like:

You are given a 2D grid representing a room, and you are given N gates. 
The grid is filled with either a wall, a gate, or an empty room. 
Your task is to fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. 
If it is impossible to reach a gate, that room should remain empty.
